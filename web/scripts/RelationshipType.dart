  you're actually reading through my garbage code?
  sorry about the mess, most of this was written when i was still a beginner.
  (heck the original version of this note was, too. i went back and edited it when i needed to make changes.)

  i'm not sure who you are, but i know what people i shared this file with.
  since i have to say this to all of you, each for very different reasons, I
  might as well do it here.

  Thank you. Seriously. Y'all have been through a ton recently, and that never
  stopped any of you from being kind and supportive friends to each other.
